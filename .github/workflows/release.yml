# Description of this workflow, can be anything you want
name: Package and release

# We need to let GitHub know _when_ we want to release, typically only when we create a new tag.
# This will target only tags, and not all pushes to the master branch.
# This part can be heavily customized to your liking, like targeting only tags that match a certain word,
# other branches or even pull requests.

# A workflow is built up as jobs, and within these jobs are steps.

  # "release" is a job, you can name it anything you want
  release:

    # We can run our steps on pretty much anything, but the "ubuntu-latest" image is a safe bet

    # Specify the environment variables used by the packager, matching the secrets from the project on GitHub
